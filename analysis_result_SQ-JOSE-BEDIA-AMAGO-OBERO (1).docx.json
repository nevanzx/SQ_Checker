The vast majority of questions (particularly in Tables 2 and 3) are phrased as noun phrases or incomplete sentences rather than full statements requiring Likert-scale agreement. Table 1 (Food Safety) contains many questions that are either imperative commands, factual definitions, or scientifically verifiable statements rather than measures of the respondent's attitude or behavior. The variable definitions provided in the survey introduction are not consistently reflected in the question phrasing. Grammatical errors are frequent throughout the survey.",
